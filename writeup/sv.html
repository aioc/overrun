<p>
  In this ruthless capitalist world, you have found yourself as the CEO of a
  new startup located in Sillycone Valleý. Like any good startup, you
  initially <strike>command</strike>employ exactly one <i>drone</i>; a
  mindless employee who obeys your every whim.
</p>
 
<p>
  Sillycone Valleý is fortunately laid out as a flat grid (though some squares
  are not traversable because of ongoing construction), and your company
  has a fixed office on this grid. There are also multiple <i>Venture
  Capitalists</i> located in the Valleý; gullible investors who will throw
  money at your company any time a drone visits their door.
</p>

<p>
  To grow your company, you may spend any amount of money to buy a number of
  energy drinks, all of which you give to a drone as a 'hiring bonus' -- drones
  don't require anything as silly as an annual salary or health insurance --
  and the drone will immediately appear at your office. Of course, to get money
  you only need to visit a <i>Venture Capitalist</i>; no work actually needs to
  be completed for your drones to suck up their money. Each visit to the house
  of a <i>Venture Capitalist</i> will earn you exactly $1; you may visit a
  house once per turn. You are guaranteed that the cost of energy drinks will
  remain invariant for the length of time you are in the Valleý.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, yours is not the only company in Sillycone Valleý! Other
  companies have drones too, however you do not stand for fair competition (and
  neither do they) so your overall objective is to <i>destroy</i> their company
  (after all, your &lt;x&gt;-as-a-service-in-the-cloud idea doesn't work if two
  people do it). A company is considered <i>destroyed</i> if it has no drones
  left. Through impeccable town planning, Sillycone Valleý is rotationally
  symmetric for each office in the area, so there are no competitive advantages
  or disadvantages for the starting offices.
</p>

<p>
  When two drones from competing companies arrive at the same location in
  Sillycone Valleý, they will both participate in a code duel (fuelled only by
  their energy drinks). The drone with the smaller drink count (denote this
  drone's energy drink count as 'a') will eventually pass out and, since they
  have no more energy drinks, be forced to quit the company and find a job that
  pays an actual salary. The drone with the larger stock will have their stock
  <i>reduced</i> by 'a', but continue on as an drone.
</p>

<p>
  Due to FCC restrictions, all companies in Sillycone Valleý are required to
  be completely transparent both in terms of their financial state and the
  location of their drones -- this means that you will always have full
  information on every other company in the Valleý
</p>

<h3>Victory</h3>

<p>
A startup is victorious if all other startups have been eliminated. Your plan
for world <strike>domination</strike>optimisation can be put into place

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>
We provide a g++-compiled .o file that does network communcation and general
utility items for you. You <b>must</b> not write a <pre>main()</pre> function
since our library will provide this.
</p>

<p>
You should implement the functions described below, in your source file
</p>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>You'll need the following line to start with:</p>
<pre>#include "valley.h"</pre>

<p>This file also defines a number of constants that you might find useful to
  work with; we strongly recommend quickly reading through it to get familiar
  with them.
</p>

<h3>clientRegister</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientRegister()</i> is called when the client first logs on to the
  server. You should call <i>setName(const char* name)</i> to define
  the name of your AI and <i>setColour(int r, int g, int b)</i> to
  elect a preferred colour. Names can be up to 16 characters long and
  colour components are between 0 and 255 inclusive. Names will be
  deduplicated by appending a random sequence of digits to the end; you should
  be creative to avoid this!
</p>

<pre>void clientRegister(void) {
  setName("BlackPerl");
  setColour(41, 35, 52);
}</pre>


<h3>clientInit</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientInit(int numPlayers, int boardSize, int playerID)</i> is
  called at the start of a game. The argument <i>numPlayers</i>
  specifies the number of players in this game. The
  argument <i>boardSize</i> specifies the height/width of the game
  board, which is always square. The argument <i>playerID</i>
  specifies your player ID throughout the game. Any persistent data
  structures that you use throughout the course of a game are best
  initialised here.
</p>

<pre>void clientInit(int numPlayers, int boardSize, int playerID) {
    numP = numPlayers;
    size = boardSize;
    myID = playerID;

    // Initialise state...
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j &lt; size; j++) {
            board[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientInit()</i> must return within one second.</p>

<h3>clientMoneyInfo</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientMoneyInfo(int pid, int moneyCount)</i> is called once for each player
  currently in the game, before your turn. It informs you that the player with
  id <i>pid</i> has <i>moneyCount</i> money in the bank.
</p>

<pre>void clientMoneyInfo(int pId, int moneyCount) {
    money[pid] = moneyCount;
}</pre>

<h3>clientTerrainInfo</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientTerrainInfo(int x, int y, int type)</i> will be called for each
  square on the board, before you take your turn. The possible values for
  <i>type</i> are as follows:
  <table>
      <tr><td>Value</td><td>Meaning</td></tr>
      <tr><td>0</td><td>Blank square</td></tr>
      <tr><td>-99</td><td>Untraversable square</td></tr>
      <tr><td>&gt;0</td><td><i>Venture Capitalist</i> willing to offer at most this much money</td></tr>
      <tr><td>&lt;0</td><td>Player base. If <i>type</i> = <i>-n</i>, this
          indicates the base of player <i>n</i></td></tr>
  </table>
</p>

<pre>void clientTerrainInfo(int x, int y, int type) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        board[y][x] = type;
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientTerrainInfo</i> must return within one second.</p>

<h3>clientDroneLocation</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientDroneLocation(int pid, int id, int x, int y, int numCans)</i> is
  called for each drone currently on the board, before you take your turn.
  This function tells you which player's company the drone belongs to, the
  drone's employee id, the x and y coordinates of the drone and the number of
  cans of energy drink they have remaining.
</p>
<p>
  The drone's ID will be constant for the duration of the game
</p>

<pre>void clientDroneLocation(int pid, int id, int x, int y, int numCans) {
    drones[y][x] = Drone(pid, id, numCans);
}</pre>
    
<p><i>clientDroneLocation</i> must return within one second.</p>

<h3>clientDoTurn</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientDoTurn()</i> is called when it's your turn to play a turn. There
  are 4 different functions that you might find useful to call in this
  function.
</p>

<p>
  You may call <i>makeMove(int unitId, int move)</i>. The argument
  <i>unitId</i> is the id of one of <b>your</b> drones, and the argument
  <i>move</i> will represent a either a compass direction (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH,
  WEST) or EXTRACT, indication that you wish this drone to extract $1 from the
  <i>Venture Capitalist</i> on this square.
</p>

<p>
  If you attempt to call <i>makeMove(uid, move)</i> more than once per unit
  the behaviour the server assumes you meant is undefined.
</p>

<p>
  You may also call <i>build(int cost)</i>. This function indicates that you
  wish to hire a new employee, spending $<i>cost</i> on energy drinks. There
  are two auxillary functions that may inform your choice of <i>cost</i>: you
  may call <i>int getCost(int numCans)</i> to get the cost required to
  employ a drone with <i>numCans</i> cans of energy drink, and you may call
  <i>int getCans(int cost)</i> to get the number of cans given you intend to
  spend $<i>cost</i> on hiring an employee.
</p>

<p><i>clientDoTurn()</i> must return within <b>two</b> seconds.</p>

<pre>void clientDoTurn() {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numMyUnits; i++) {
        move(i, DOWN); 
    }
    build(getCost(getCans(1))); // getCans is the inverse of getCost, so this
                                // is equivalent to build(1); 
}</pre>
